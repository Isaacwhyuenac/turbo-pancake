# ON THE LIST ASIA Interview

## Prerequite
* nodejs v12.15.0
* php v7.3.9

I write my answers on `MAC` environment and have not tested them in `LINUX` or `Windows` environments.

Each file corresponds to my solution in either node.js or php.

No dependencies for solution in php. However, for those in node.js, you should first install dependencies list in `package.json` first by

```zsh
  # choose one you like
  yarn
  npm install
```

To run the program, you should

```zsh
  node question1.js
  node question2.js
  node question3.js
  node question4.js

  php question1.php
  php question2.php
  php question3.php
  php question4.php
```
